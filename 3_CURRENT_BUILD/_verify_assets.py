"""Asset receipt for HI02H11_L02_S01. Shape-agnostic: every expectation is read from card.json,
so this stays honest if the card changes.

Run:  PYTHONUTF8=1 py -3.13 _verify_assets.py

The duration/length check exists because of a real defect this build hit: four clips had their
TEXT changed in the builder while KEEPING their clip ids, so the old audio stayed on disk and
nothing flagged it — `vo_t1_instruction` was still a 16.25 s recording of a line that had been cut
to 56 characters. A stale clip is invisible to an existence check and to a file-size check. Speech
runs at a fairly steady rate, so seconds-per-character outside a generous band means the file and
the text have drifted apart.

#
# An absolute seconds-per-character band does not work: a 3-character word carries fixed
# leading/trailing silence, so its s/char is naturally 4x a long sentence's, and the band needed
# to accept both is too wide to catch anything. What DOES work is comparing each clip against
# other clips of the SAME text length — the lesson is full of templated lines, so most clips have
# real peers. This is how the em-dash truncation was actually found: `vo_yes_din` ran 0.89-1.29 s
# over four takes while its 39-character siblings ran 4.09 s and 4.29 s.
#
# Cause, for the record: an em-dash before a short final word makes the TTS model cut the clip.
# Probed head to head — em-dash 0.73-1.05 s, comma 1.53-2.21 s, danda 1.13-2.01 s for the same
# words. Every affected line now uses a comma or a danda instead.
